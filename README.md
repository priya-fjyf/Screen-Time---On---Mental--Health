# Screen Time and Mental Health Analysis using Machine Learning

This project explores the correlation between screen time and mental health indicators such as mood score, anxiety, and sleep patterns. The goal is to predict mental well-being based on daily screen usage using various machine learning algorithms.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Understand the impact of excessive screen time on mental health.
- Predict mood scores and mental wellness levels using screen time and behavioral features.
- Identify key factors that contribute to changes in emotional well-being.

## 📊 Dataset Features
- Daily screen time (hours)
- App categories used (social, educational, entertainment)
- Sleep duration
- Mood score (self-reported)
- Anxiety level (optional)
- Physical activity level

## 🧠 Applied Machine Learning Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📈 Key Results
- Visualizations of screen time vs. mood score
- Model accuracy comparisons
- Feature importance for mental health prediction

## 📦 Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib
- streamlit (if deployed)

## 💡 Future Work
- Include real-time monitoring
- Use deep learning models like LSTM for time-series mood prediction
- Connect with wearable data for better accuracy
